        let f_name = 'ashwin', l_name = 'mandaokar' // multiple variable in one line, That might seem shorter, but we donâ€™t recommend it. For the sake of better readability, please use a single line per variable..

        // const is keyword to declare the variable, its also like the let but cant able to change its values.

        const full_name = 'Ashwin Mandaokar';

        // Variable rule
        // can't start variable name with a digit
        // 2. it contains digits, alphabest & symbols('$' and '_')
