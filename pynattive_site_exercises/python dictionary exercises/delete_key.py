# Exercise 6: Delete a list of keys from a dictionary

sample_dict = {
    "name": "Kelly",
    "age": 25,
    "salary": 8000,
    "city": "New york"
}

# Keys to remove
keys = ["name", "salary"]

# for key in keys:
#     del sample_dict[key]

# print(sample_dict)

print({k: v for k, v in sample_dict.items() if k not in keys})

# Other solution

sample_dict = {
    "name": "Kelly",
    "age": 25,
    "salary": 8000,
    "city": "New york"
}
# Keys to remove
keys = ["name", "salary"]

for k in keys:
    sample_dict.pop(k)
print(sample_dict)
