# OOP Exercise 6: Class Inheritance

'''
Create a Bus child class that inherits from the Vehicle class. The default fare charge of any vehicle is seating capacity * 100. If Vehicle is Bus instance, we need to add an extra 10% on full fare as a maintenance charge. So total fare for bus instance will become the final amount = total fare + 10% of the total fare.

Note: The bus seating capacity is 50. so the final fare amount should be 5500. You need to override the fare() method of a Vehicle class in Bus class.

Use the following code for your parent Vehicle class. We need to access the parent class from inside a method of a child class.

class Vehicle:
    def __init__(self, name, mileage, capacity):
        self.name = name
        self.mileage = mileage
        self.capacity = capacity

    def fare(self):
        return self.capacity * 100

class Bus(Vehicle):
    
    def fare(self):
        total_fare = super().fare()
        final_fare = total_fare * 1.10 # additional 10%
        return final_fare

School_bus = Bus("School Volvo", 12, 50)
print("Total Bus fare is:", School_bus.fare())
